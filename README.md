# Pronunciation Pal
## Introduction
Effective pronunciation is a significant challenge for many language learners, often leading to communication barriers. PronunciationPal addresses this issue by offering a user-friendly platform for practice and improvement. The primary target audience includes individuals who are deaf and hard of hearing, language learners across various age groups and proficiency levels, and speech therapy clients.

## Developing

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab

```
